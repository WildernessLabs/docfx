The current release of Meadow is [Beta2](../Beta2/index.md)

## Current Release - Beta 2

[Beta 2 Release Notes](/guides/Release_Notes/Beta2/)

## Future

### Beta 3 - April Target

* **PWM** - Hardware Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) support. Currently, in beta 2 we have a low frequency SoftPwmPort that can be used to test PWM Peripherals.
* **Digital Protocols**; I2C, SPI, Serial (UART)
* **Network** - Integrated WiFi support.
* **Flash Deploy** - Command line deployment to flash, so we can remove the dependency on semihosting (in which we load the app.exe from the attached computer's `/tmp` directory).
* **IDE Plugin** - First draft of the IDE plugin which will include a default Meadow application template and some basic deployment integration.

### Release Candidate 1 - May Target

RC1 will see final hardware to kickstarter backers and the last of the major feature set released, including:

 * Meadow Board in-IDE Activation
 * One touch deploy of Meadow OS + Meadow Apps
 * Mono Linking and other optimizations (bonus feature)
 * Bluetooth APIs
 * CAN?

APIs will still be unlocked and subject to feedback and change.

### Post RC-1

 * USB OTG Support
 * Serial Audio
