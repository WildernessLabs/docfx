The SHT31D is a temperature and humidity sensor with a built in I2C interface.  The sensor has a typical accuracy of +/- 2% relative humidity and +/- 0.3C.

## Purchasing

The SHT31D temperature and humidity is available on a breakout board from Adafruit:

* [SHT31D Temperature and Humidity Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2857)

The SHT31D can operate in interrupt or polling mode.  The default mode is interrupt mode.

#### Interrupt Mode

The application below generates and interrupt when the temperature or humidity changes by more than 0.1 &deg;C.  The sensor is checked every 100 milliseconds.

```csharp
using System.Threading;
using Meadow;
using Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Atmospheric;

namespace SHT31D_Sample
{
    public class Program
    {
        static IApp _app; 
        public static void Main()
        {
            _app = new App();
        }
    }
    
    public class App : AppBase<F7Micro, App>
    {
        public App ()
        {
            // Create a new SHT31D object that will generate interrupts when
            // the temperature changes by more than +/- 0.1C or the humidity
            // changes by more than 1%.
            SHT31D sht31d = new SHT31D(temperatureChangeNotificationThreshold: 0.1F,
                humidityChangeNotificationThreshold: 1.0F);

            // Hook up the two interrupt handlers to display the changes in
            // temperature and humidity.
            sht31d.HumidityChanged += (s, e) =>
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Current humidity: " + e.CurrentValue.ToString("f2"));
            };

            sht31d.TemperatureChanged += (s, e) =>
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Current temperature: " + e.CurrentValue.ToString("f2"));
            };

            // Main program loop can now go to sleep as the work
            // is being performed by the interrupt handlers.
            Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Polling Mode

The application below polls the sensor every 1000 milliseconds and displays the temperature and humidity on the debug console:

```csharp
using System.Threading;
using Meadow;
using Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Atmospheric;

namespace SHT31D_Sample
{
    public class Program
    {
        static IApp _app; 
        public static void Main()
        {
            _app = new App();
        }
    }
    
    public class App : AppBase<F7Micro, App>
    {
        public App ()
        {
            SHT31D sht31d = new SHT31D(updateInterval: 0);

            Console.WriteLine("SHT31D Temperature / Humidity Test");

            while (true)
            {
                sht31d.Update();
                Console.WriteLine("Temperature: " + sht31d.Temperature.ToString("f2") + ", Humidity: " + sht31d.Humidity.ToString("f2"));
                Thread.Sleep(1000);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

##### Example Circuit

The SHT31D breakout board from Adafruit is supplied with pull-up resistors installed on the `SCL` and `SDA` lines.

The `ADR` line is tied low giving and I2C address of 0x44.  This address line can also be tied high and in this case the I2C address is 0x45.
