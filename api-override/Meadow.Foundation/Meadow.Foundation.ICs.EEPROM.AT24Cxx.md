The AT24Cxx series of chips provide a mechanism for storing data that will survive a power outage or battery failure.  These EEPROMs are available in varying sizes and are accessible using the I2C interface.

The following example shows how to turn on and off the LED using the `IsOn` property, and uses a `StartBlink(onDuration, offDuration)` API method to make the LED blink staying on for 500ms (0.5s) and off for 1000ms (1s):

```csharp
using System.Threading;
using Meadow;
using Meadow.Foundation.ICs.EEPROM;

namespace LedSample
{
    public class Program
    {
        static IApp _app; 
        public static void Main()
        {
            _app = new App();
        }
    }
    
    public class App : AppBase<F7Micro, App>
    {
        public App ()
        {
            var eeprom = new AT24Cxx(0x57);

            var memory = eeprom.Read(0, 16);
            for (ushort index = 0; index < 16; index++)
                Console.WriteLine("Byte: " + index + ", Value: " + memory[index]);

            eeprom.Write(3, new byte[] { 10 });
            eeprom.Write(7, new byte[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 });
            
            memory = eeprom.Read(0, 16);
            for (ushort index = 0; index < 16; index++)
                Console.WriteLine("Byte: " + index + ", Value: " + memory[index]);
            

            Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
        }
    }
}
```

##### Example Circuit

The chip used to develop this library is one that is available on a common DS3231 RTC module with EEPROM memory module:
